      <p style="color:white;font-size:23px">Grupul Plictiselii or GP, means The Group of Boredom or Boredom's Group. It was originally only the name of our groupchat, but it rapidly became something more. It's something that we identify by and are proud of. One of our most easy to recognize traits is being so distanced from the Gen-Z culture even though we are all part of Gen-Z. We are not snowflakes, we don't get offended by jokes and dumb shit. Hell, i don't even remember the last time any one of us got offended. Grupul Plictiselii was anti snowflakes before every-fucking-one was a snowflake. Most groups have some sort of message or a goal, but we don't. We had no reason to make this website, but we still did it, because at the end of the day we are just trying to have fun on the internet and maybe in the process we'll be able to build one of the most down to earth comunities.</p>
